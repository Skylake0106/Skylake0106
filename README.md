### About Me
More than anything else, I love learning, and technology is the best place to do that. As for what technology I enjoy, I love everything from scientific computing to PC building. Currently, I have experience with some full stack frameworks like Django and Next.js, API, High Performance Computing, and Data Structures. As for where I want to grow, I want to master full stack development further, learn cloud computing, machine learning, more HPC, and scientific computing. 

Right now I am an undergraduate researcher for the Applied Computing Institute working with professors and fellow researchers on the processing and analyzing of immense single cell data sets, specifically I work on parallelizing non-negative matrix factorization!

A lot of my interests are flavored by the amazing professors I have, the research I do for the ACI, and my club. All of these have led me to the decision to pursue computing as much as I can both in research and industry and improve my talents as far as they can go.

As for my other hobbies, I love to practice mixology and bartend for myself, play video games, read, and explore new places!
