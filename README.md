### About Me

I am a senior at Grand Valley State University studying computer science with a minor in mathematics and employed as an undergraduate researcher for the Applied Computing Institute. Currently, I am researching methods and programs to facilitate biomedical research through data compression and machine learning. I’m also the president of the Computing Club of GVSU, leading dozens of students in gaining technical and interpersonal skills for the world of computing. When I’m not working on research, school, or club, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, playing soccer, reading, and mixing drinks.

I had not even considered research as an option going into my junior year of college, but I had received an offer for a research position with a new professor. After working with my mentor for a few months and the opportunity to work with other researchers, I knew that research was the right path for me. Since then, I have been enjoying my time conducting research and have only confirmed my decision to pursue self-improvement through doing the best research possible.
